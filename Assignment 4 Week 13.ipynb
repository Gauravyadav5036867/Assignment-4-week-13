    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another, typically for the purpose of efficient storage, transmission, or processing. In data science, data encoding plays a crucial role in preparing and manipulating data for analysis, modeling, and visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful are as :\n",
    "1. Standardization: Data encoding helps in standardizing data formats. For instance, converting categorical variables into numerical representations (like one-hot encoding) allows algorithms to interpret them correctly.\n",
    "2. Normalization: Encoding techniques such as normalization help to scale numerical data to a common range, making it easier to compare and analyze.\n",
    "3. Reduced Storage: Encoding techniques can sometimes reduce the storage space required for data, especially when dealing with large datasets. For example, using encoding schemes that represent data more efficiently can lead to significant space saving.\n",
    "4. Improved Performance: Efficient encoding can lead to improved performance of algorithms and models. By encoding data in a way that optimizes computational efficiency, data scientists can speed up processing times and reduce resource consumption.\n",
    "5. Handling Categorical Data: Data encoding allows data scientists to handle categorical data effectively. Techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding convert categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.\n"

    "\n",
    ". If the categorical variable has no inherent order or hierarchy among its values and represents unordered categories, nominal encoding (or label encoding) could be a suitable choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding:\n",
    "\n",

    ". One-hot encoding would create five binary variables, each representing one of the unique values in the categorical variable.\n",
